## _Android phone application_



### Main areas of focus
  I was mainly using this project as an opportunity to study some new things, and refresh some old things. I had taken a break from coding for a little while and felt a bit rusty.
  Much of the architecture was new for me such as: 
  - Dagger + Hilt, I had used Kodein in the past
  - Moshi, I had used a long time ago but favored Gson (Gson's nullibility rules for malformed json was an issue on this project).
  - Flows, I've built architecture with Coroutines before but had used Deferred/LiveData in the past
  - StateFlows
  
  I spent the majority of the time learning about these API's and then integrating them into a MVVM architecture I was familiar with. I wouldn't say it's yet my strength,
  but I do enjoy putting the pieces together in a software environment. I love seeing how the code has evolved for me over time from using Java with RxJava, 
  to Kotlin with LiveData, to Coroutines. It's incredibly simplified nowadays and feels great to write.
  
  I spent less time working with the UI. I tried to make it appealing but simple without having to think about it too much. I enjoy building UI and it's what I feel is my strength.
  There's still much out there I'd like to learn and get better with, such as CustomViews, theming, MotionLayout/animation, databinding, and navigation safe args. This project favors
  ConstraintLayouts and a RecyclerView, along with Glide for image caching, placeholder and error states, and photo manipulation (rounding). I've used the Material Design library
  for some font theming, and the Navigation Component for navigation prep. 
  
  
### Copied-in code 
  Relied on two tutorials to learn more modern techniques from youtube streamers: 
  - [Coding In Flow](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_Fh8kvtkVPkeihBs42jGcA)
  - [Phillip Lackner](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKNTZMRHPLXfqlbdOI7mCkg)
  
  _I felt both of these guys had great detailed instruction through using Flow and Coroutines inside an MVVM architecture._ 
  
  Other code I have used on previous projects that have evolved in my own architecture over time:
  - [Android guide to app architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide)
  - [Reso Coder](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSIvrn68cUk8CS8MbtBmBkA)
  - [Udemy and Udacity](https://www.udemy.com/course/android-arch-components-view-model/)
  
  I rely on many of the popular dependencies such as Retrofit, Moshi, Dagger, etc...

### How long the project took
  As I was using this project as a bit of a study guide as I went along, it probably took me a little longer; actual coding time was around 5 hours.

### Anything else...
  I struggled with the testing portion of this. I haven't done much testing in my career unfortunately, as it wasn't not prioritized in my last role. 
  I've done some testing over the years on different platforms, but never much on Android. I'm definitely keen to learn more as it's fundamental to my skillset
  as an engineer moving forward. Given the opportunity to pair code with your team at Square, I will be prepared to discussed and show what I have learned in the meantime.
  
  #### Where I'd like to focus before interview
  - Testing, as mentioned, TDD
  - Database design and testing
  - Coroutines and Flow
  - UI Databinding, CustomViews, animation
  - Lifecycles and scopes
  - MVI and other Android design patterns
  - writing solid javadoc
